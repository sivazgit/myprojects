        <h3>PENINSULA</h3>
        <p>An island is a piece of ground that is surrounded by a body of water such as a lake, river or sea. Islands
            are smaller than continents.Confirming Darwin's observation, study shows that islands are home to more
            unique species than the mainland.</p>

        <h3>PEAKS & STREAMLETS</h3>
        <P>Mountains are created by deep-seated geological processes that raise the surface of the earth,
            A river in the mountains or hills will usually have a deep and
            steep V-shaped valley as the fast moving water cuts away at the rock as it flows downhill.
